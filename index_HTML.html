            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I'm an undergraduate computer science and psychology student and researcher at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>. <br><br>

                My software engineering background is diverse; I’ve worked as a software engineer intern at <a href="https://www.schwab.com/td-ameritrade">Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade</a>, often being involved in DevOps-esque projects and familiarizing myself with CI/CD tools and frameworks. I was part of a startup called <a href="https://zyntora.com/">Zyntora</a>, an attempt at a virtual real-estate and social media app that was ahead of its time. I’ve created Chrome extensions, most notably Swati AI, a Chrome extension that allows you to get an AI-based simplified explanation of whatever you highlight in-browser and in-context… for free. More than anything, I have experience creating, training, and fine-tuning ML models and creating front-end web or iOS apps for all of my ideas. <br> <br>
                
                I've built and sold some companies, namely Volk, an E-Commerce accelerator, and Molly and the Mop, an employment referral agency. The crux of both of these companies was my innate understanding and relentless pursuit of a better user experience, complemented by my capacity to leverage digital media for distribution. Volk encompassed many brands (which you probably saw online around 2021-2023), some of which I built from scratch and exited from profitably, and even some that were “flipped” with LBOs and value-additions. Molly and the Mop was the first of its kind in my city and it was a way to give local independent house cleaners consistent customer flow. We created a marketplace that connected independent contractors with eager customers looking for their expertise. <br> <br>
                
                I took a sharp turn from entrepreneurship to research at the end of 2023 and now I’m focusing on deep learning research. More specifically, I'm researching prediction, consciousness, and sensorimotor roots of meaning at the <a href="https://yschoe.github.io/research/">Brain Networks Laboratory</a> under Dr. Choe. At the moment, we are focused on expanding upon <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00781">this paper</a> in a paper we’re calling “Developing Intrinsically Motivated Autonomous Agents with
                Self-Organized Meaning”. I was also awarded the FIGURES Scholarship to do research at the <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~hsieh/Rockwell_Automation_Lab.html">Rockwell Automation Laboratory</a>. My research there focuses on deep learning applications to industrial engineering problems and the development of Industry 4.0.<br> <br>
                
                I'm a stoic, a voracious reader, and a lover of all combat sports.
