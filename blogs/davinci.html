            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-4">Posted on Sep 17, 2024 by Alex Alvarez</p>
            
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Over the summer, I read a lot of books. I hope that doesn't come off as vain by that's not my attempt at virtue signalling, it's meant to give the following statement more weight: Walter Isaacson's "Leonardo Da Vinci" is my favorite book of this year and it likely changed my life considerably. </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">I've always respected Leonardo Da Vinci. I didn't know what he really did except for painting the Mona Lisa and making flying machines or some sketches of a man. In general, I always looked up to the people who were different. The misfits as I like to call them (and myself). The most influential movie in my life was the Steve Jobs movie with Ashton Kutcher, depicting the rise of Apple Computer. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but I've always had this anti-establishment sentiment that yearned for disruptive innovation. Leonardo Da Vinci was the blueprint.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Pig’s Heart and the Valve Discovery</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">In one of his more famous anatomical experiments, da Vinci molded a pig’s heart to understand how the blood flows through its valves. Through careful observation, he was able to sketch detailed anatomical drawings that were far ahead of his time. He described how the heart valves worked, ensuring one-way blood flow through the chambers of the heart. His sketches included intricate depictions of vortices and swirling blood flows around the valves—something that wouldn't be scientifically confirmed until 400 years later.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">This discovery was revolutionary for several reasons. First, it showcased how da Vinci wasn’t afraid to go beyond mere observation and employ hands-on experimentation. By literally molding the heart, he grasped a concept that took centuries for modern science to catch up with. His work on the heart exemplifies how his approach to problem-solving transcended the traditional boundaries of art and science. Da Vinci's genius lay in his ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas to create something entirely new.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">A Mind Unbound by Disciplines</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">What made Leonardo so remarkable wasn’t just his skill as an artist or a scientist, but his interdisciplinary approach. He believed that to fully understand one thing, you had to understand everything. His notebooks, filled with ideas ranging from flying machines to the anatomy of trees, exemplify his belief in the interconnectedness of all things. His ability to draw from different areas of study is what allowed him to innovate and make groundbreaking discoveries centuries ahead of his time.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">This methodology, this commitment to broad and deep exploration, is perhaps one of da Vinci’s most valuable lessons for us today. In a world that often prizes specialization, his life reminds us that the most powerful ideas often come from connecting dots between fields that seem unrelated at first glance.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Leonardo da Vinci’s contributions to anatomy, engineering, and art illustrate his incredible ability to connect different ideas and make discoveries that were far ahead of his time. His study of the pig's heart and the heart valves is just one example of how thinking across disciplines can lead to revolutionary insights. In da Vinci, we find not only a great artist but also a mind that embraced the interconnectedness of all knowledge.</p>
