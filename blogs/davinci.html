                Over the summer I read Walter Isaacson's "Leonardo Da Vinci". I think it was my favorite book read this year and it likely changed my life considerably. 
                I've always respected Leonardo Da Vinci but I didn't know what he really did except for painting the Mona Lisa and making flying machines or some sketch of a man. In general, I always looked up to the people who were different, the <strong>misfits</strong> as I like to call them (including myself). 
                The most influential movie in my life was the Steve Jobs movie with Ashton Kutcher which depicted the rise of Apple Computer. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but I've always had this anti-establishment sentiment that yearned for disruptive innovation. Leonardo Da Vinci is the blueprint for what we would now call a "disruptive innovator".

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Pig’s Heart and the Valve Discovery</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Leonardo correctly described the function of heart valves, particularly the aortic valve, around 1513. He observed that the valve's cusps (flaps) close to prevent blood from flowing backward.
                His observations were later confirmed centuries later in 1969, engineers used modern equipment to film the movement of water through a glass model of the aorta, confirming Leonardo's theories about the heart valve's function and the formation of vortices (swirling patterns) in blood flow.
                </p>

            <!-- <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">This discovery was revolutionary for several reasons. First, it showcased how da Vinci wasn’t afraid to go beyond mere observation and employ hands-on experimentation. By literally molding the heart, he grasped a concept that took centuries for modern science to catch up with. His work on the heart exemplifies how his approach to problem-solving transcended the traditional boundaries of art and science. Da Vinci's genius lay in his ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas to create something entirely new.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">A Mind Unbound by Disciplines</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">What made Leonardo so remarkable wasn’t just his skill as an artist or a scientist, but his interdisciplinary approach. He believed that to fully understand one thing, you had to understand everything. His notebooks, filled with ideas ranging from flying machines to the anatomy of trees, exemplify his belief in the interconnectedness of all things. His ability to draw from different areas of study is what allowed him to innovate and make groundbreaking discoveries centuries ahead of his time.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">This methodology, this commitment to broad and deep exploration, is perhaps one of da Vinci’s most valuable lessons for us today. In a world that often prizes specialization, his life reminds us that the most powerful ideas often come from connecting dots between fields that seem unrelated at first glance.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Leonardo da Vinci’s contributions to anatomy, engineering, and art illustrate his incredible ability to connect different ideas and make discoveries that were far ahead of his time. His study of the pig's heart and the heart valves is just one example of how thinking across disciplines can lead to revolutionary insights. In da Vinci, we find not only a great artist but also a mind that embraced the interconnectedness of all knowledge.</p>
